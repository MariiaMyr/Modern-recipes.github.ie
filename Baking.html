                        <h3><strong><em>Baguette Recipe</em></strong></h3>
                        <p><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
                            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (approximately 110°F)</li>
                            <li>Cornmeal for dusting</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong><em>Instructions:</em></strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. In a separate small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy. Gradually add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture, mixing until a dough begins to form.</li>
                            <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal parts. Roll each piece into a long, thin loaf, about 16 inches long. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal and place the loaves on the sheet, ensuring they are not touching.</li>
                            <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let them rise again for about 30 minutes, or until puffed up.</li>
                            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven and Prepare for Baking:</strong> Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Make several diagonal slashes on top of each loaf with a sharp knife.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bake the Baguette:</strong> Place a small oven-safe dish filled with water on the bottom rack of the oven to create steam. Bake the loaves for about 25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Remove the baguettes from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. Enjoy fresh, or store in a paper bag to maintain the crust's texture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> A freshly baked baguette can be served with butter, cheese, or used to make sandwiches. Its crispy crust and soft interior are sure to delight any bread lover.</li>

                            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

                            <li>1 cup warm water (approximately 110°F)</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
                            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                            <li>Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong><em>Instructions:</em></strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Prepare the Yeast Mixture:</strong> In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the yeast mixture and 1/4 cup olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until the dough comes together.</li>
                            <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare the Focaccia:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto an oiled baking sheet. Stretch the dough into a rough rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Let the dough rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Dimple the dough with your fingertips. Drizzle with additional olive oil. Sprinkle the minced garlic, chopped rosemary, and coarse sea salt evenly over the top.</li>
                            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                            <li><strong>Bake the Focaccia:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Remove the focaccia from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for a few minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> This rosemary garlic focaccia is perfect as a side to any meal, as an appetizer, or simply enjoyed on its own with a bit of balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping.</li>
